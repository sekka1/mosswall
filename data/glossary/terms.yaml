# Moss Wall Glossary
# Common terms and definitions related to moss walls

terms:
  - term: "Acrocarpous Moss"
    definition: "Moss that grows upright in clumps or cushions, as opposed to spreading horizontally. Examples include mood moss and cushion moss."
    related: ["Pleurocarpous Moss", "Mood Moss"]

  - term: "Bryophyte"

    related: ["Dormancy", "Rehydration"]

  - term: "Dormancy"

    related: ["Sporophyte", "Antheridia", "Archegonia"]

  - term: "Sporophyte"
    definition: "The diploid (double chromosome set) phase of moss that produces spores. It appears as a thin stalk with a capsule, attached to and dependent on the gametophyte."
    related: ["Gametophyte", "Sporangium", "Spore"]

  - term: "Antheridia"
    definition: "Male reproductive organs of moss that produce motile sperm. Found on the gametophyte during the sexual reproduction phase."
    related: ["Archegonia", "Gametophyte", "Sexual Reproduction"]

  - term: "Archegonia"
    definition: "Female reproductive organs of moss that contain eggs. Fertilization occurs when sperm swim through water to reach the archegonia."
    related: ["Antheridia", "Gametophyte", "Sexual Reproduction"]

  - term: "Protonema"
    definition: "The filamentous, algae-like growth stage that develops immediately after spore germination. It eventually develops into the mature gametophyte."
    related: ["Spore", "Gametophyte", "Germination"]

  - term: "Sporangium"
    definition: "The capsule at the top of the sporophyte where spores are produced through meiosis. Contains the operculum (lid) and sometimes a peristome."
    related: ["Sporophyte", "Spore", "Operculum", "Peristome"]
