notes: |
  Haircap Moss (Polytrichum commune) is one of the tallest and most 
  structurally complex mosses, sometimes reaching 20 cm in height. Unlike
  most mosses, it has primitive internal conducting tissues similar to
  vascular plants. The name "haircap" comes from the hairy calyptra 
  (covering) that protects the spore capsule. The distinctive rosette
  growth pattern and lance-shaped leaves make it easily identifiable.
  This moss has historical uses including stuffing for mattresses and
  as lamp wicks due to its absorbent properties.
