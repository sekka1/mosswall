notes: |
  Sphagnum moss is ecologically one of the most important plants on Earth.
  It's responsible for forming peat bogs, which are massive carbon sinks
  storing approximately 30% of the world's soil carbon despite covering
  only 3% of land area. The remarkable water-holding capacity (up to 20x
  its dry weight) comes from specialized hyaline cells that act as water
  reservoirs. Sphagnum also creates acidic conditions through cation
  exchange, which preserves organic matter and inhibits bacterial decay.
  The species name "platyphyllum" refers to its distinctively flat, broad
  leaves compared to other Sphagnum species.
