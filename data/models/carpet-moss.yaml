notes: |
  Carpet Moss (Hypnum cupressiforme) is one of the most widespread and 
  adaptable moss species in the world. Its common name "cypress-leaved" 
  refers to the distinctive curved, overlapping leaf arrangement that 
  resembles cypress foliage. This moss forms beautiful, soft carpet-like 
  mats that make it popular for landscaping and decorative applications.
  It's particularly valued for its ability to grow on various substrates
  including rocks, bark, and soil.
