notes: |
  Tree Moss (Anomodon attenuatus) is named for its distinctive growth
  pattern of forming "aprons" or "skirts" around the bases of trees.
  The nickname "Poodle Moss" comes from its curly, textured appearance
  that resembles poodle fur. This moss has evolved specialized holdfast
  structures that allow it to cling firmly to tree bark. It creates a
  beautiful natural effect in landscaping when allowed to grow around
  tree trunks, mimicking its wild forest habitat. The moss thrives in
  the stable microclimate found at tree bases where moisture and shade
  conditions are consistent.
