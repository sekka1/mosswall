notes: |
  Fern Moss is prized for its exceptionally delicate, fern-like appearance
  created by intricate bi- to tri-pinnate branching. This fine structure
  gives it an elegant, feathery texture that's highly valued in landscaping
  and terrarium design. It requires more humidity and moisture than many
  other mosses, making it ideal for naturally damp, shaded areas or enclosed
  terrarium environments. The species name "delicatulum" refers to its
  delicate, refined appearance.
