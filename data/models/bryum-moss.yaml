characteristics:
  growth_form: "Acrocarpous (upright)"
  height: "2-3 cm"
  color: "Green to yellow-green"
  texture: "Dense cushion-like tufts"
  leaves: "Oval to lance-shaped, with pointed tips"
  capsules: "Pear-shaped, pendulous spore capsules"

ideal_conditions:
  light: "Partial sun to full sun (sun-tolerant)"
  moisture: "Moderate, tolerates dry periods"
  substrate: "Soil, rocks, pavement cracks, disturbed areas"
  humidity: "Adaptable to various humidity levels"
  temperature: "Hardy across temperate climates"

habitat:
  primary: "Urban environments, disturbed soils, pavement cracks"
  secondary: "Grasslands, roadsides, gardens"
  adaptations:
    - "Exceptional sun tolerance (unusual for moss)"
    - "Thrives in disturbed urban areas"
    - "Tolerates foot traffic and poor soil"

distribution:
  range: "Cosmopolitan - found worldwide"
  regions:
    - "North America"
    - "Europe"
    - "Asia"
    - "Africa"
    - "Australia"
  climate_zones: "Temperate to subtropical"

ecological_importance:
  - "Pioneer species on disturbed soils"
  - "Soil stabilization in urban areas"
  - "Biodiversity support for microorganisms"
  - "Bioindicator for urban environmental conditions"

uses:
  landscaping:
    - "Sunny terraces and patios"
    - "Between pavers and stepping stones"
    - "Rock gardens with sun exposure"
    - "Green roofs"
  applications:
    - "Low-maintenance groundcover in sunny areas"
    - "Urban greening projects"
    - "Erosion control on slopes"

care_requirements:
  watering: "Moderate; more drought-tolerant than most mosses"
  maintenance: "Minimal; naturally resilient"
  establishment: "Fragments readily colonize suitable substrates"

notes: |
  Bryum moss is one of the few moss species that tolerates direct sunlight,
  making it valuable for sunny landscaping applications where most mosses
  would struggle. Its ability to thrive in urban environments, including
  sidewalk cracks and between pavers, demonstrates remarkable adaptability.
  The pear-shaped pendulous capsules are a distinctive identifying feature.
