notes: |
  Mood Moss (Dicranum scoparium) gets its common name from the way its
  appearance changes with moisture levels - appearing lush and vibrant
  green when moist, then taking on a more subdued, yellowish tone when
  dry (reflecting the moss's "mood"). The name "broom moss" comes from
  the distinctive curved leaves that all sweep in the same direction,
  resembling a broom. This moss forms thick, velvety cushions that are
  highly prized in landscaping for their soft texture and natural beauty.
  It's particularly effective as an accent on rocks and boulders.
