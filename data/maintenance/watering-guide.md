# Watering and Misting Guide for Moss Walls

A comprehensive guide to keeping your live moss wall properly hydrated.

## Overview

Unlike traditional plants, moss doesn't have roots that absorb water from soil. Instead, moss absorbs moisture directly through its leaves from the air. This means proper humidity and misting are crucial for a healthy moss wall.

## Watering Methods

### Misting (Recommended)

The best way to water a moss wall is through regular misting with a spray bottle or misting system.

**How to mist:**
1. Use a fine-mist spray bottle
2. Hold 6-12 inches away from the moss
3. Spray evenly across the entire surface
4. Aim for the moss to be damp, not dripping wet

**Frequency:**
- **Humid environments (60%+ humidity):** 2-3 times per week
- **Average indoor conditions (40-60% humidity):** Daily or every other day
- **Dry environments (below 40% humidity):** 1-2 times daily

### Humidifiers

For larger installations or dry climates, consider using a humidifier:

- Place near the moss wall
- Aim for 50-70% ambient humidity
- Use a hygrometer to monitor levels

## Water Quality

**Best options (in order of preference):**
1. **Rainwater** — Natural and chemical-free
2. **Distilled water** — No minerals or chlorine
3. **Filtered water** — Removes most chemicals
4. **Tap water** — Let sit 24 hours to allow chlorine to evaporate

**Avoid:**
- Hard water with high mineral content
- Softened water (contains salts)
- Hot water

## Signs of Improper Watering

### Under-watering
- Moss turns light green or yellowish
- Edges curl or crisp up
- Texture becomes dry and brittle
- Color fades

### Over-watering
- Moss appears dark or blackened
- Musty or moldy smell
- Soft, mushy texture
- Mold growth on surface

## Seasonal Adjustments

### Winter
- Indoor heating reduces humidity
- Increase misting frequency
- Consider running a humidifier

### Summer
- Air conditioning also dries air
- Monitor humidity levels closely
- Mist more frequently if needed

## Tips for Success

1. **Consistency is key** — Establish a regular misting schedule
2. **Morning misting** — Allows moss to absorb water throughout the day
3. **Check before misting** — Touch the moss; if it feels dry, it needs water
4. **Drainage matters** — Ensure excess water can drain away
